# Magnus-Fraud-detector
A graph-based financial fraud detection system for bank transactions

# Overview

This project implements a **Graph-Based Financial Fraud Detection System** entirely in **C++**, using fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** â€” without relying on any external ML or graph libraries.

It models bank transactions as a **directed weighted graph**, extracts structural and behavioral features for each account, and applies a **custom-trained mathematical fraud detection model** built from scratch.

The goal is to detect suspicious transaction patterns such as:
- **Cyclic money flows** (A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ A)
- **Densely connected clusters** (potential fraud rings)
- **Highly central nodes** (accounts acting as money hubs)

# Input Format: 

**You can input .csv files in the following format:**
```
sender,receiver,amount,timestamp,type
U128,U28,2770.33,2025-10-21 12:20:59,cash_in
U10,U47,5630.12,2025-10-21 15:11:05,transfer
```

# Output format:
```
Account_ID  | Fraud_Score
U47         | 0.92
U85         | 0.78
U128        | 0.15
```
